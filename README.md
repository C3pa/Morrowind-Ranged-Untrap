# Ranged Untrap

Use your bow, crossbow, or thrown weapons to trigger the trap on doors and containers from afar. Successfully disarming a trap with a ranged weapon will award experience to both security and marksman skills (but a bit smaller amount than when using a probe). You can configure the factors that influence disarming chances in the mods MCM.

Failing to untrap some door or a container will cast the trap spell on you! You can configure if this only happens on critical fails, regular fails, or if this feature is completely disabled.

# Usage

You can obtain the mod on its [Nexusmods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55203).
